## Kegged.
A beer app completely driven by user activity to discover and talk about breweries and brews in your local city.

## Motivation
It's tough deciding which brewery to go to on a given day. Breweries are always changing - the draft list changes, the setting changes, and maybe even management changes. Kegged is a one-stop app that allows locals to see beer lists and discuss breweries in an open forum for others to see. With Kegged, you'll always know what to expect at a brewery on any given day.
